# Overview

In my exploration for learning the programming language C++, I created a math quiz program. In this program I have the user take a quiz that generates random math problems. The quiz will end once the user gives the wrong answer. Once the quiz ends, the user will be shown how many questions they got right as well as a history of all the questions they saw (from newest to oldest). Making this program has helped me learn and understand C++ and how it differentiates as a low-level language from some of the other programs I have already learned like c#.

# Development Environment

 * Visual Studio Code
 * g++ 12.2.0
 * GNU gdb (GDB) 12.1
 * C++17

# Useful Websites

* [MYSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
* [Visual Studio Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)
* [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm)


# Future Work

* have a more flexible correct answer (the correct answer does not always need to have 6 decimal places)
* implement more complex math problems (calculus)
* have the user choose which level of math they want (either basic or geometry)
